Tested transistor with 12V VDS with 5V VGS and a load of 2A. Temperature rise of ~20C. Mosfet mounted on SMD adapter and tested in a breadboard. Controlled 5V VGS with a 5HZ square wave to test switching. Same results. Pull-down resistor required for the test, as the voltage was generated with a power supply. In the final product, the gate will be pulled down by the microcontroller pin through a series resistor to limit instantaneous current into and out of the gate capacitance.
